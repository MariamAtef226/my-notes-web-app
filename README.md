# my-notes-web-app 📓

### Project Description :page_facing_up:
A dynamic interactive note web app that supports notes styling using markdown language. The project is a part of Bob Ziroll's 'Learn React' course on Scrimba. The core structure of the app was provided, and my tasks were based on adding the required extra features using React.js.
There was an issue concerning the used React-mde library since it doesn't work with React 18, yet. As a result, I've hardcoded some of the libraries styling. The functionality of the library was forced into the project. The project is still on-going. 
The aim of the project is practicing what we've learned throughout the 3 sections of the course and makign sure we've fully understood it all.

# my-notes-web-app 📓

### Project Description :page_facing_up:
A dynamic interactive notes web app that supports markdown language. The project is a part of Bob Ziroll's 'Learn React' course on Scrimba. The base code of the app was provided for us to build more features on it. The aim of the project is practicing what we've learned throughout the 3 sections of the course and learning about & using firebase. 

** There was an issue concerning the used React-mde library since it doesn't work with React 18, yet. As a result, I've hardcoded some of the libraries styling. The functionality of the library was forced into the project.
